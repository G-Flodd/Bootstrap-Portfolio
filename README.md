# Welcome to my portfolio page

## Description: 

My objecctive was to make a portfolio page to aid my web dev career. 

How have I done this? I have built a web page to load my work ads well as link to several of my personal information pages.

## Usage
The website consists of a single page broken down in to an interactive header linking to a main section, work grid and a footer.
